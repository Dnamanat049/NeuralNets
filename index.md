# NBAI Project

## Introductory Paragraph

"$10 the Knicks lose." Watching an NBA game with others, questions like this about small-scale betting frequently appear as a means of making the event more entertaining for the group. Even if you are not particularly disposed to either of the teams, it is easy to pick one and become enamored with the game to the point where you are genuinely sad or upset if "your" team loses. While not always safe or ethical, it certainly draws you into the event in a way that few other sports-adjacent activites can. Taken on a larger scale, this small-scale betting has become a phenonemon with companies like DraftKings and FanDuel that enable this behavior on a countrywide scale becoming worth billions of dollars. Given how popular this subculture has become, our team believes it would be a fun challenge to create a model that is able to "win" at this game.

For this project, we would like to create a neural network model that takes information about two NBA teams, the Vegas betting odds for that matchup, and decides whether or not to make a bet on one of the teams. This model will be trained on data that includes information about indidivual players, the stadium, the coach, and other factors relevant to a team's performance in a game. The model would output a % chance that one of the teams will win, and then a separate, simpler model will evaluate whether to make a bet on that team given the over/under on the odds.

## Background Paragraph

One of the most difficult parts of this problem is factoring in the odds portion to find mispriced bets. Unlike other sports prediction algorithms, we are not aiming to simply predict the outcome of the game based on historical data. We are attempting to factor in odds that bookmakers have placed on games into the prediction algorithm to see if bets are worth placing or not. The main goal of a bookie is to make money by expanding their margins to the point where they know they will make money regardless of how many bets are placed on one team or the other. We are first going to have to figure out what the odds are of each team winning and then compare this to what the betting odds are to see which bets have the most hidden value. Doing this would allow users of our algorithm to exploit mispriced bets at a higher rate than normal.

## Transition Paragraph

## Ethics Sweep

### Should we even be doing this?

We believe that this project is largely safe and ethical—in fact our team views our mission as a means to level a gambling playing field that is unfairly biased in favor of bookies and gambling organizations that have robust resources and statistical methods, and one that is biased against the average bettor. However, we recognize a handful of problems that might arise from this project: 
1. An individual with a gambling problem might see the win % predictions as a justification for their gambling behavior. Given the numbers behind their bet, they might see their actions as "reasonable" and "logical" rather than a random, intuition based gamble. We by no means endorse this behavior—while this model is able to output a number and dollar amount for betting, it is really just another form of "intuition" that is the result of amalgamating our team members' biases in choosing what data to train the model on, what variables to choose, and what the process for making bets should be. This system is no more robust or objective than the average bettor's intuition, given that it has our own biases included.
2. This model could be used by bookies and gambling organizations to generate even more accurate odds than they already offer, further tilting the scale against the average bettor. We recognize that bookies and gambling organizations are much more likely than a casual bettor to be actively searching for cutting-edge methods to improve their profits, and as such this model may end up being used for the opposite of its intentions.

### What might be the accuracy of a simple, non-ML alternative?

Bookies calculate odds using a combination of sports analysts, mathematical models, and a variety of adjacent data (how much money is being bet on the underdog, for example, might affect the odds by forcing bookies to balance the spread so that they can protect their downside). Much of this work is outsourced to third-party odds-generating firms, hence the uniformity of the odds that one tends to see between sports betting sites. Average bettors rely on much simpler methods, often intuition, to make their bets. However, a selection of bettors specialize in sports gambling and have their own sophisticated models and methods to predict outcomes.

On the accuracy of bookies' odds, lead gambling expert Professor Leighton Vaughan Williams of the Betting Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University reports that odds shorter than 2-1 are frequently accurate. However, the long-shot bets that reflect true underdogs become progressively more unreliable as the odds drop below ~14-1, with the true chances of a win being either much lower than the odds would suggest (https://www.sciencefocus.com/science/how-accurate-are-the-odds-quoted-by-bookmakers/).

### What processes will we use to handle appeals/mistakes?

In a betting model like the one proposed, an appeal/mistake will result in a loss of money and as such we take this scenario very seriously. Firstly, we will suggest betting small amounts so as to not encourage risky behavior that would lead to dangerous losses. Secondly, we would like to factor our appeals/mistakes back into the model so as to make it more accurate. The wonderful element of sports is that games are almost always happening, and so even our incorrect guesses will become part of a valuable treasure trove of data that will be replenished everyday. Finally, if the model is consistently creating losses at any point, our team will reexamine the data used to train the model to see if it is still valid. For example, the game of basketball has changed dramatically over the past 20 years as the 3-pointer has become the centerpoint of many teams offenses. A model from 20 years ago would not take this into account, and as such it would be much less accurate.

### How diverse is our team?

Our team is diverse in athletic background, gambling knowledge, career interests, life backgrounds, and so much more. In terms of demographics, we recognize that while we are racially and culturally diverse, we are all men and as such are lacking a key component of any truly diverse team. However, we will strive to make a product and interface that is attractive and user-friendly to bettors of all identities.

### Is our data valid for its intended use?

We are assuming that our data will be valid for its intended use because it will include results of games as well as what the betting odds were on those games in the first place.

### What bias could be in our data?

One of the main biases that could exist in our data would be in the odds themselves. Bookmakers attempt to balance all the bets places on every outcome so as to ensure that they are making profit no matter what the outcome of the game is. This process is know as the vig, or vigorish. Overrounding also takes place, which is the actual percentage over 100% that a book is for a certain event that is taking place. Leading up to certain sporting events, bookmakers will adjust the lines to make bets look more attractive so as to maximize profits. This is where the bias comes in because a teams odds of winning a game are not accurately reflected in the betting odds placed on the game.

### How could we minimize bias in our data and model?

One way we could minimize the bias in our data would be to take only the initial odds that were released on an event, not any of the odds that were altered leading up to the start of it, so as to obtain the most accurate betting odds for that event. This way, we know exactly what bookmakers initially thought the odds would be when releasing them to the public.

### How should we “audit” our code and data?

The best way to audit our code/data would be to make sure that all of the odds we are using in our model are those that were the first to come out about the event (reflecting the most accurate initial impression of the event from bookmakers) and removing and altered odds from the data. This way we know we are not including any data that could be used to entice various bettors into making unwise bets.
